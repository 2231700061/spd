This is a simple example to illustrate what the testing tool built in this paper consumes and produces.

Inputs(uploading to the guest machine which could be executed symbolically):
An implementation under test (IUT) and a test oracle(EEFSM) 

Outputs: 
An IUT passes the test if the sequences of events in all execution paths are accepted by the EEFSM, and fails otherwise.

Usage for this example:
sudo sh script_run.sh // an faulty IUT has been uploaded to the guest machine inthis example.

All the output files are in a folder named last-run-info, the warnings.txt file has all useful info for each execution path. A testing process terminates if all execution paths have been analyzed, a faulty execution path detected or memory is low(i.e., 4 Gb RAM could run for about 1 hour). All the other output files contain many types of statistics during the execution. 

e.g.,
A correct execution path
001,178,801,178,801,178,801,178,801,164,4199,*accept

A faulty execution path
001,178,801,178,801,178,801,178,801,112,201,1121,199,901,1121,199,901,1121,101,1121,143,301,199,901,1121,178,801,178,801,199,901,1121,178,801,178,801,131,112,201,1121,199,901,1121,199,901,1121,129,901,1121,143,301,199,901,1121,178,801,178,801,199,901,1121,178,801,178,801,131,112,201,1121,199,901,1121,143,301,199,901,1121,178,801,199,901,1121,178,801,199,901,1121,178,801,178,801,131,112,216,686,6105,no matching:event 6 with 3 in S5faults detected
